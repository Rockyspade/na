## OS X, LINUX, BSD

If you need to install Ruby it's better to use something like RVM or RBENV.

You can of course use the Ruby shipped with your system but it will require root privileges and is not recommended.

## WINDOWS

Ayadn 1.0.x isn't compatible with Windows: there's too many issues due to external Gems and POSIX-dependant tools.
