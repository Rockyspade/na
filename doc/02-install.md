# INSTALL

`gem install ayadn`

`gem update ayadn`

`gem uninstall ayadn`  

## OS X, LINUX, BSD

Please use something like RVM or RBENV to install Ruby if necessary.

You can also use the Ruby shipped with your system but it will require root privileges.

## WINDOWS

Ayadn 1.0.x isn't compatible with Windows: there's too many issues due to external Gems and POSIX-dependant tools.
