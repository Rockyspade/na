Ayadn is configurable: colors, stream content, behavior, etc. 

There's also two exclusive antispam and filtering features: a blacklist of users/mentions/hashtags, and Jason Irwin's NiceRank to kick out spammers and bots from Global, with a customisable threshold.

Last but not least: Ayadn supports multiple ADN accounts! 

Authorize as many accounts as you wish, and simply switch between them in a second.
