# NOWPLAYING

Post what you're listening to!

## iTunes

OS X only.

`ayadn nowplaying`

`ayadn -np`

Ayadn will grab information from your running iTunes, format it, insert the *#nowplaying* hashtag then ask for your confirmation before posting it.

It will also grab a 30 seconds preview and the album art from the iTunes Store. You can prevent this behavior by adding the `--no-url` option (short: `-n`).

## Last.fm

`ayadn nowplaying --last-fm`

`ayadn -np -l`

Same behaviour and options as above.
