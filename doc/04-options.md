# OPTIONS

Note: options are only described once in this manual (in the first example for 'Streams', 'Timeline'). 

**However, options are available for mosts of streams!** 

They're described only once to ensure this documentation keeps being readable.

You can always check if a command has specific options with 

`ayadn help COMMAND`  

or, for subcommands:

`ayadn COMMAND help SUBCOMMAND`
