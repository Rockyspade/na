AYADN
=====

[App.net](http://app.net) command-line client.

The purpose of Ayadn is to give you access to all the features of App.net from the command line.

View or scroll all streams, view or scroll conversations and posts from specific users or mentioning a user, follow/unfollow users, star/unstar/repost/etc, get information about users and their followers/followings, search for words or hashtags, list and download your files, view all your channels including Broadcasts and Patter rooms, write single-line or multi-line posts, send private messages, view geolocation data, etc.

More than 50 features await for your Geekiness to command them.

Ayadn is configurable: colors, timelines, durations, aliases, etc. 

You can also specify many options from the commande line, like show the raw JSON instead of the formatted response, show only a number of most recents posts, show only new posts, etc.

There's also exclusive features, like the Blacklist: feed this mini database with usernames, client names or hashtags and Ayadn will never show you any post containing any of these elements.

Last but not least: Ayadn supports multi-accounting! Authorize as many accounts as you wish and simply switch between them with a keystroke.
