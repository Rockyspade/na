AYADN
=====

- follow/unfollow users, star/repost/mute/block/unstar/etc 
- create/manage silent bookmarks for conversations

- search for words, hashtags, post annotations, channels, etc
- extract links from conversations, streams, posts, etc
- list and download your files

- #nowplaying from iTunes or Last.fm, with album art and store link
- #movie creates a post from a movie title with poster, etc

Ayadn is configurable: colors, stream content, durations, aliases, etc. 

There's also two exclusive antispam and filtering features: a blacklist of users/mentions/hashtags, and Jason Irwin's NiceRank to kick out spammers and bots from Global, with a customisable threshold.

Last but not least: Ayadn supports multiple ADN accounts! 

Authorize as many accounts as you wish, and simply switch between them in a second.
