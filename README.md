AYADN
=====

[App.net](http://app.net) command-line client.

Written in Ruby, Ayadn is a toolbox for your ADN accounts.

Ayadn is compatible with Ruby 1.9.3 but works better with Ruby 2.0 or newer.  

## INSTALL

Install:

`gem install ayadn`  

Update:

`gem update ayadn`

### OS X, LINUX, BSD

Please use something like RVM or RBENV to install Ruby if necessary.

You can also use the Ruby shipped with your system but you shouldn't, as it would require root privileges.

### WINDOWS

You have to run one more command:

`gem install win32console -v 1.3.2`
