AYADN
=====

[App.net](http://app.net) command-line client.

The purpose of Ayadn is to give you access to all the features of App.net from the console.

View or scroll all streams in your Terminal, view or scroll conversations and posts from specific users or mentioning a user, follow/unfollow users, star/unstar/repost/etc, get information about users and their followers/followings, search for words or hashtags, list and download your files, view all your channels including Broadcasts and Patter rooms, write single-line or multi-line posts, send private messages, view geolocation data, etc.

This CLI has more than 50 features awaiting for your Geekiness to command them.

Ayadn is configurable: colors, timelines, durations, aliases, etc. 

You can also specify many options, like show the raw JSON instead of the formatted response, show only a number of most recents posts, show only new posts, etc.

There's also two exclusive antispam and filtering features: a blacklist, and Jason Irwin's NiceRank.

Last but not least: Ayadn supports multiple ADN accounts! Authorize as many accounts as you wish and simply switch between them with a keystroke.
